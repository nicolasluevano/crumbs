- add a button the feed that redirects back to profile page
  - remove link from logo
  
- add ability for user to upload an avatar pic
  - display this avatar on users post on the feed
    -have thought about making a settings page for user
    -would think avatar upload could be there
    -was thinking about giving user ability to change username, email, password type options

- logout buttons
  -we have logout button on profile page might, if you want that on other pages or a different location that would be the code you would want to use

- display number of likes on feed posts
  - add ability to like from feed?
  - should be as easy as copying that portion of the code from posts page ill look into it
  -wasnt fully easy but minor tweaks it is working now could use some formatting
      -working on formatting a little bit (Jessie)

- fix post timestamps
  - I think it might be using the local time of the server (Imran's?), rather than the user's local time. Add option to set user's timezone in settings?

-add floating "return to top" arrow in feed?
